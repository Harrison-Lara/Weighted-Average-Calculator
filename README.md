# Weighted-Average-Calculator

You are asked to develop an application with a main goal to calculate the weighted average scores of the students enrolled in 201R class. Your application will read input from two files. First file is called “INFO.txt” and it includes a list of current students with their student IDs and first and last names. Second file is called “Grades.txt” and it includes a list of student IDs and their grades in this course. The grades are listed in the following order “quiz1 quiz2 midterm Final.” (quizzes are graded out of 10 points each, exams are graded out of 100 points each) Note that not all students have grades (some are auditing). Also note that the students’ IDs in the second file are not necessary consistent (in the same order) with ID’s in the first file
